# Source DDC

### About the library
Source DDC is a library for the simulation and estimation of Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) Models.

### Currently Implemented Models
Source DDC provides tools for constructing single-agent DDC models with a multivariate state-space and any number of choices.

Currently implemented estimation algorithms rely on Maximum Likelihood:

- Nested Fixed Point Algorithm (Rust, 1987)
- CCP Estimator (Hotz & Miller, 1993)
- Nested Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (Aguirregabiria & Mira, 2002)

Areas of future development include the implementation of simulation-based algorithms, dynamic games and improvements that allow the distributed estimation of large-scale models.

## Installation

The current version has been tested on Python 3.6 and 3.7.
To install, clone or download the repository to your local environment and run `pip install .` from the root directory where the `setup.py` file is.
This installs the necessary dependencies.


## Basic Components of a DDC model

A DDC model is made of the following components:

- Agents
- A utility function to be maximized by the agent
- A set of available choices
- The state-space
- The beliefs about the evolution of the state, given in the form of transition matrices
- A discount factor, representing the degree of preference of short-term utility over the long-term

Currently, Source DDC does not support dynamic games. See the **Future Areas of Work** for more.

The model variables are defined in the following way:

```python
n_choices = 2
n_states = 5
discount_factor = 0.95
```

### Defining the state-space using a State Manager

The state space is defined by employing a *State Manager*, which performs operations on the state-space.
When the state-space is multi-dimensional, since it reduces the complexity of managing several state variables and transition matrices.

A State Manager can be instantiated in the following way:

```python
from source_ddc.probability_tools import StateManager
state_manager = StateManager(miles=n_states)
```

### Transition Matrices

The beliefs of the agent about the evolution of the state-space is defined as a numpy array with dimensions n_choices * n_states * n_states.
In other words, you need to specify a number of squared transition matrices equal to the number of choices. See the example below:

```python
import numpy as np
transition_matrix = np.array(
        [
            [
                [1., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
                [0.1, 0.9, 0., 0., 0.],
                [0., 0.1, 0.9, 0., 0.],
                [0., 0., 0.1, 0.9, 0.],
                [0., 0., 0., 0.1, 0.9]
            ],
            [
                [0.4, 0.6, 0., 0., 0.],
                [0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0., 0.],
                [0., 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.],
                [0., 0., 0.1, 0.3, 0.6],
                [0., 0., 0., 0.1, 0.9]
            ]
        ]
    )
```

### The Utility Function

It is expressed as a python function that receives three arguments: the parameter values, an array of choices and an array of states.
For example: 

```python
    def utility_fn(parameters, choices, states):
        [variable_cost, fixed_cost] = parameters
        m_states, m_actions = np.meshgrid(states, choices)
        return (variable_cost * np.log(m_states + 1) - fixed_cost * m_actions).reshape((len(choices), -1, 1))
```

## Simulating data

Source DDC includes an easy way of performing Monte Carlo simulations.

You can simulate new data in the following way:


```python
from source_ddc.simulation_tools import simulate

df, ccp = simulate(100, 10, n_choices, state_manager, true_params, utility_fn, discount_factor, transition_matrix)
```

This function returns a tuple containing the simulated data and the conditional choice probabilities. 


### Estimating a model

The algorithms are included in the `dynamic` module.

You need to create an instance of the algorithm with the necessary data and use the `estimate` function to perform the estimation:

```python
from source_ddc.algorithms import NFXP
algorithm = NFXP(
    df['action'],
    df['state'],
    transition_matrix,
    utility_fn,
    discount_factor,
    parameter_names=['variable_cost', 'replacement_cost']
    )

result = algorithm.estimate(start_params=[-1, -1], method='bfgs')
```

The `result` object inherits from the Statsmodels [GenericLikelihoodModelResults](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/dev/generated/statsmodels.base.model.GenericLikelihoodModelResults.html).

A summary of the results can be obtained with `result.summary()`.

## Testing

Tests run against the installed version. To run them, install the library (in a virtual environment if necessary).

Then, install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the root directory.

Tests are found inside the `/test/` directory and are of three kinds:

- Unit tests: employ Monte Carlo simulations to verify that the results returned by the algorithms are as expected.
Run them using `pytest .` from the `/test/unit/` directory.

- Benchmarks: compare the speed of the `estimate` method of each algorithm.
Run them using `pytest .` from the `/test/benchmark/` directory.

- Profiling: measure the time that key parts of the algorithms take when estimating. Helps spot bottlenecks.
Run them using `pytest . --profile` from the `/test/performance/` directory. This will generate profile files which you can visualize using tools like [snakeviz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/)
